# Get Started
There are a few things you have to get installed bfore you can run this very basic API.
### Pre API steps

*  make sure you have `node` installed, you can download node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*  also make sure you have `yarn`, you can download yarn [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) 
   *  yarn is just like npm so you can use either yarn or npm. npm come with node while yarn has to be installed

## Running the API
* Open the api folder in VSCODE or any text editor of your choice (not notpad ++ for god sake)
* in a terminal/cmd/powershell window open the folder directory and run the following command
  * `yarn install` if your using yarn like me
  * `npm install` if your using npm which is fine also
* Now you can run the API with the following command
  * `yarn start` or `npm start`

# Using the api
There are a few things we still need to get installed to get to interact with the API
we need some sort of software for now that we can use to interact with the API routes
below i listed 2 options:

* Postman can be downloaded from [here](https://www.getpostman.com/)
* Insomnia can be downloaded from [here](https://insomnia.rest/)

Either of the listed options can be used.
